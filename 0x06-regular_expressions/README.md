Project Title: Regular Expression Challenge
Overview
This project is a part of the ALX System Engineering & DevOps curriculum and focuses on using regular expressions (regex) with the Oniguruma library in Ruby. In this project, you will build Ruby scripts to match specific patterns using regex.

Project Details
Concepts
Regular Expression: Explore the concept of regular expressions and how they can be applied to text pattern matching.
Background Context
Use the Oniguruma library for regular expressions in Ruby.
Replace the regexp part of the provided Ruby code in the example.rb file to build your own regular expressions.
Tasks
Task 0: Simply Matching "School"
Create a Ruby script that matches the word "School" using regex.
Example: ./0-simply_match_school.rb School | cat -e should output School$.
Task 1: Repetition Token #0
Create a Ruby script that matches specific patterns using repetition tokens.
Example: ./1-repetition_token_0.rb should match certain patterns.
Task 2: Repetition Token #1
Create a Ruby script to match patterns using repetition tokens.
Example: ./2-repetition_token_1.rb should match specific patterns.
Task 3: Repetition Token #2
Create a Ruby script to match patterns with repetition tokens.
Example: ./3-repetition_token_2.rb should match certain patterns.
Task 4: Repetition Token #3
Create a Ruby script to match patterns using repetition tokens, without square brackets.
Example: ./4-repetition_token_3.rb should match specific patterns.
Task 5: Not Quite HBTN Yet
Build a regular expression that matches strings starting with 'h,' ending with 'n,' and having any single character in between.
Example: ./5-beginning_and_end.rb 'hn' | cat -e should output an empty line.
Task 6: Call Me Maybe
Create a regular expression to match 10-digit phone numbers.
Example: ./6-phone_number.rb 4155049898 | cat -e should match the provided number.
Task 7: OMG WHY ARE YOU SHOUTING?
Create a regular expression to match capital letters.
Example: ./7-OMG_WHY_ARE_YOU_SHOUTING.rb "I realLy hOpe VancouvEr posseSs Yummy Soft vAnilla Dupper Mint Ice Nutella cream" | cat -e should output ILOVESYSADMIN$.
Task 8: TextMe (Advanced)
Create a script that extracts sender, receiver, and flags from log entries.
Example: ./100-textme.rb '[log entry]' should extract and format the information.
