##Tasks
Task 0: What Happens When...
In this task, I wrote a blog post explaining the step-by-step process when a user types "https://www.google.com" in their browser and presses Enter. The post covers essential components like DNS request, TCP/IP, firewall, HTTPS/SSL, load balancer, web server, application server, and database.

##Task 1: Everything's Better with a Pretty Diagram
For this task, I created a schema illustrating the flow of the request, incorporating key elements such as DNS resolution, encrypted traffic, firewall, load balancer, web server response, application server process, and database interaction.

##Task 2: Contribute!
In this advanced task, I contributed to the open-source project "What Happens When" on GitHub. I submitted a pull request that adds meaningful value to the project, addressing the scenario when the "g" key is pressed.
