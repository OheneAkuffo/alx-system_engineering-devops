##0x19 Postmortem Project

###My First Postmortem Issue Summary Duration: The outage occurred on February 16, 2024, from 1:00 AM to 4:00 AM (UTC).

###Impact: The web application's login functionality was down during this period. Approximately 30% of users experienced login failures, leading to service disruption.

###Root Cause: The root cause of the outage was identified as an issue with the authentication server, which failed to respond to login requests.

###Timeline 10:00 AM: Issue detected through monitoring alerts indicating a spike in failed login attempts. 10:05 AM: Actions taken to investigate server logs, network traffic, and user complaints. 11:00 AM: Misleading investigation paths explored, such as checking database connections and load balancer configurations. 12:00 PM: Escalated the incident to the DevOps team for further analysis. 1:30 PM: Issue resolved by restarting the authentication server. Root Cause and Resolution Root Cause: The issue was caused by a memory leak in the authentication server process, leading to unresponsive behavior.

###Resolution: The problem was resolved by restarting the authentication server, freeing up the consumed memory and restoring normal functionality.

###Corrective and Preventative Measures Improvements/Fixes:

Implement regular monitoring for memory usage on critical server processes. Conduct a code review to identify and address potential memory leaks in the authentication server code.

Tasks:

Patch the authentication server to prevent memory leaks. Enhance monitoring systems to provide early warnings for abnormal resource usage. Schedule regular server maintenance to proactively address potential issues.
